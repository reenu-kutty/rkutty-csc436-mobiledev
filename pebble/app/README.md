1. My project is a rock collecting app! I like collecting rocks and have wanted a nice place to store my rock photos for a while. I created this app so users can view their whole dollection in one place, and apply tags and descriptions so they can revisit past samples later. 

Unfortunately, I did not get to finish this app. The biggest missing piece of this app is the ability to create a sample with a photo, since I had some trouble with the camera. However, you can still scroll through entries that are in the Data Source. If I had more time, I would have allowed users to do a file upload instead of taking a picture in app, but I really envisioned that as being most convenient to users, and held out hope that I would get it to work eventually lol.

I will probably continue working on this during Spring break. Future features that I want to implement include GPS functionality, so you can drop a pin where you find a rock, and view that when looking through your collection. Maybe a matching map view. And also a searching feature if you want to see your collection by tag. I think it might also be cool to implement authentication, and then have user accounts where you can add friends and see their collections.

3. I didn't use anything too unique, but I did utilize the built in camera, and compose navigation.

4. This app should run on most android devices, it does require a camera however (and subsequent camera permissions)

5. As far as above and beyond, I'm not really sure. I will say that I made sure I came up with and was creating an app that I will actually use, and one that looked pretty and intuitive lol. Beyond that, I did do some over-promising and under-delivering which resulted in defunct features. Regardless, I really enjoyed this class! I didn't expect to enjoy app dev this much. I'll share the app with you when I am finished :)
